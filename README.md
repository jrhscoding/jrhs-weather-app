# jrhs-weather-app

This weeks project was utilizing third party apis to generate and display data from the api onto the page.
This was a very challenging homework as the api we utilized seemed to be a bit outdated and required multiple api's from the api provider.
One issue is that the UV api is no longer available however I believe I was able to meet most of the criteria.

The criteria for this homework is as follows:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
